# C (programming language)

 C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. Nowadays, it is one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989  and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization.

C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program that is written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code; the language has become available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers. 


## Character set 

The basic C source character set includes the following characters:

1. Lowercase and uppercase letters of ISO Basic Latin Alphabet: a–z A–Z
1. Decimal digits: 0–9
* Graphic characters: ! " # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~
* Whitespace characters: space, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, newline
* Newline indicates the end of a text line; it need not correspond to an actual single character, although for convenience C treats it as one. 


## Reserved words

C89 has 32 reserved words, also known as keywords, which are the words that cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined:

* auto
* break
* case
* char
* const
* continue
* default
* do
* double
* else
* enum
* extern
* float
* for
* goto
* if
* int
* long
* register
* return
* short
* signed
* sizeof
* static
* struct
* switch
* typedef
* union
* unsigned
* void
* volatile
* while 

## Operators

C supports a rich set of operators, which are symbols used within an expression to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for:

* arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
* assignment: =
* augmented assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=
* bitwise logic: ~, &, |, ^
* bitwise shifts: <<, >>
* boolean logic: !, &&, ||
* conditional evaluation: ? :
* equality testing: ==, !=
* calling functions: ( )
* increment and decrement: ++, --
* member selection: ., ->
* object size: sizeof
* order relations: <, <=, >, >=
* reference and dereference: &, *, [ ]
* sequencing: ,
* subexpression grouping: ( )
* type conversion: (typename) 

### Related languages

C has both directly and indirectly influenced many later languages such as C#, D, Go, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, Perl, PHP, Python, and Unix's C shell.[40] The most pervasive influence has been syntactical, all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression syntax of C with type systems, data models and/or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically.
