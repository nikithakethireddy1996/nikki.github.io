# C (programming language)

_C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. Nowadays, it is one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989  and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization._

_C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program that is written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code; the language has become available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.

## Character set 

**_The basic C source character set includes the following characters:_**

1. _Lowercase and uppercase letters of ISO Basic Latin Alphabet: a–z A–Z_
1. _Decimal digits: 0–9_
1. _Graphic characters: ! " # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | }_
1. _Whitespace characters: space, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, newline_
1. _Newline indicates the end of a text line; it need not correspond to an actual single character, although for convenience C treats it as one._


## Reserved words

**_C89 has 32 reserved words, also known as keywords, which are the words that cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined:_**

* _auto_
* _break_
* _case_
* _char_
* _const_
* _continue_
* _default_
* _do_
* _double_
* _else_
* _enum_
* _extern_
* _float_
* _for_
* _goto_
* _if_
* _int_
* _long_
* _register_
* _return_
* _short_
* _signed_
* _sizeof_
* _static_
* _struct_
* _switch_
* _typedef_
* _union_
* _unsigned_
* _void_
* _volatile_
* _while_ 

## Operators

**_C supports a rich set of operators, which are symbols used within an expression to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for:_**

* _arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %_
* _assignment: =_
* _augmented assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=_
* _bitwise logic: ~, &, |, ^_
* _bitwise shifts: <<, >>_
* _boolean logic: !, &&, ||_
* _conditional evaluation: ? :_
* _equality testing: ==, !=_
* _calling functions: ( )_
* _increment and decrement: ++, --_
* _member selection: ., ->_
* _object size: sizeof_
* _order relations: <, <=, >, >=_
* _reference and dereference: &, *, [ ]_
* _sequencing: ,_
* _subexpression grouping: ( )_
* _type conversion: (typename.)_

## Related languages

_C has both directly and indirectly influenced many later languages such as C#, D, Go, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, Perl, PHP, Python, and Unix's C shell.[40] The most pervasive influence has been syntactical, all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression syntax of C with type systems, data models and/or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically._
